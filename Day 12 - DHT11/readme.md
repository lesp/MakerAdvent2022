I [bought the Banana Pi Pico W from Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004775634442.html) for around Â£10.


It came with CircuitPython pre-loaded, but it would be best practice to [flash the latest version.](https://circuitpython.org/board/bpi_picow_s3/)

[Download the latest CircuitPython libraries bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) for your respective version of CircuitPython. So download 8.x for any CircuitPython 8 release.

Copy the Adafruit_dht library to the lib folder on your Banana Pi Pico W.

Save the code to the root of your Banana Pi Pico W and click Run to start.
