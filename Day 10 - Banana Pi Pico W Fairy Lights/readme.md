I [bought the Banana Pi Pico W from Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004775634442.html) for around Â£10.

It came with CircuitPython pre-loaded, but it would be best practice to [flash the latest version.](https://circuitpython.org/board/bpi_picow_s3/)

The [HTTP server is Ampule](https://github.com/deckerego/ampule) by [John Ellis (deckerego)](https://github.com/deckerego) and it is excellent!

Node-RED was used to create a simple interface to control the LEDs. [More details on the Node-RED website.](https://nodered.org/)

The GUI creation tool for Python was [EasyGUI](https://easygui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) which can be installed via pip.
